Description: # Perceptual quality metrics for TensorFlow
        
        This project contains differentiable perceptual quality metrics implemented in
        the TensorFlow framework.
        
        ## PIM
        
        This is an implementation of the perceptual information metric, as described in:
        
        > "An Unsupervised Information-Theoretic Perceptual Quality Metric"<br />
        > S. Bhardwaj, I. Fischer, J. Ballé, T. Chinen<br />
        > https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/00482b9bed15a272730fcb590ffebddd-Paper.pdf
        
        Usage:
        
        ```python
        from perceptual_quality import pim
        
        metric = pim.load_trained("pim-5")
        distance = metric((image_A/255, image_B/255))
        ```
        
        Refer to the online help of `pim.PIM.call()` for further information.
        
        ## NLPD
        
        This is an implementation of the normalized Laplacian pyramid distance, as
        described in:
        
        > "Perceptually optimized image rendering"</br>
        > V. Laparra, A. Berardino, J. Ballé and E. P. Simoncelli</br>
        > https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAA.34.001511
        
        Usage:
        
        ```python
        from perceptual_quality import nlpd
        
        distance = nlpd.nlpd(image_A, image_B)
        distance = nlpd.nlpd_fast(image_A, image_B)
        ```
        
        Refer to the online help of `nlpd.nlpd()` and `nlpd.nlpd_fast()` for further
        information.
